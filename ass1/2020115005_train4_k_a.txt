<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend <EOS> 2.6527263839645476

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes <EOS> 2.0953554580022633

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> jane was by no means better <EOS> 2.7433175854851033
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike <EOS> 2.5867956212052636
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency <EOS> 3.549551191579328
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others <EOS> 2.44570646338926
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had very little notice from any but him <EOS> 3.0752894891906584
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and missingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room <EOS> 2.8819948065009027
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty <EOS> 2.8004956555659253
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr <EOS> 2.1966204249019365

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> very nonsensical to come at all <EOS> 2.5181496176437106
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold <EOS> 2.4514312826587417
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her hair so untidy so blowsy <EOS> 0.9678691403780993
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office <EOS> 2.535874041063786
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me <EOS> 2.6246316583102556
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i thought misslizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning <EOS> 2.832785698788661
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice <EOS> 2.4256447035113067
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you observed it mr darcy i am sure said missingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition <EOS> 3.0293040287579984
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> certainly not <EOS> 2.845973324120764

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley <EOS> 3.5208193137837855
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i am afraid mr darcy observed missingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes <EOS> 2.5913158919688457
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise <EOS> 2.2288089390517687
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> a short pause followed this speech and mr <EOS> 2.854964947670891

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled <EOS> 2.795945512455037
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it <EOS> 2.937687351295868
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton <EOS> 2.41969325601913
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside <EOS> 2.752091659304457
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily <EOS> 3.3236132368598903
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable <EOS> 2.262897894588333
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy <EOS> 3.1876628981371
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations <EOS> 2.5021611767930954
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee <EOS> 2.7298024667728256

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things <EOS> 2.8968911366837573
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well <EOS> 2.4154831266149097
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying <EOS> 2.115334181991308
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded <EOS> 1.921804936556766

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room <EOS> 2.9370500801512667

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth <EOS> 2.6577026660397745
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen <EOS> 1.205816438601445
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general <EOS> 2.9568688912146057
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> nor i i am sure said missingley <EOS> 2.905559529104504
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman <EOS> 2.666065795402884
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes i do comprehend a great deal in it <EOS> 2.6610366313342255

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved <EOS> 2.278797337071859
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading <EOS> 2.6625455395410276
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women <EOS> 2.8530363894163333

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room <EOS> 2.3104177501574035
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation <EOS> 1.5036268831968962
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable <EOS> 1.006018563608812

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bingley urged mr jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians <EOS> 2.7142379454815697
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if missennet were not decidedly better <EOS> 3.049458445300363
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable <EOS> 3.1607496182166135

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation <EOS> 2.053074209225101

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield <EOS> 2.851669972412835
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable <EOS> 2.780358204138809

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting <EOS> 2.2051663131150376
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance <EOS> 1.5383279300022161
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <EOS> 2.268983491629706

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month <EOS> 2.648968943253779
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition <EOS> 3.3931292490054252
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself <EOS> 3.1997974204744746

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember missennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety <EOS> 2.560728092377245
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you <EOS> 2.781220304808892

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense <EOS> 1.9158299668546361

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter <EOS> 2.852244250783406
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when that business was over he applied to missingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music <EOS> 2.8240580161128217
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself <EOS> 2.3610726303871843
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her <EOS> 2.4798694839837783
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange <EOS> 3.0483680199282035
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present <EOS> 2.984719144547522
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the supposition did not pain her <EOS> 2.4433407386795514

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> after playing some italian songs missingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination missennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel <EOS> 2.813291108001471
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she smiled but made no answer <EOS> 2.3596442297587608

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply <EOS> 3.2534993587837597
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt <EOS> 2.2960856131701135
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare <EOS> 3.5516636678600837
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> indeed i do not dare <EOS> 4.08225215436583
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her <EOS> 2.5284748732723807
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth <EOS> 2.610300491046154
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance <EOS> 2.1122095692088174
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers <EOS> 2.4230106827799456

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> we had better go into the avenue <EOS> 1.5730859425159172

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared <EOS> 3.0990255166178478

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps <EOS> 3.1616542770126492
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he addressed himself directly to missennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation <EOS> 2.297791250592954

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made <EOS> 2.534234852056279

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other <EOS> 2.9015628261936794
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mr <EOS> 2.1170838761201214
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property <EOS> 2.761333740340276
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing <EOS> 2.133646680752405
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but here he was set right by mr <EOS> 2.6066857921269757
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen <EOS> 1.859085586383977
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he begged pardon for having displeased her <EOS> 2.729897481817612

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness <EOS> 2.5640507094097544
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable <EOS> 2.4563972259530673
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr collins was eloquent in her praise <EOS> 1.7170580643358073
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine <EOS> 3.003259025902675
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her <EOS> 2.2103873260253213
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening <EOS> 2.3481352142024754
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her <EOS> 2.7230216351647116
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations <EOS> 2.8985652852721735
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs <EOS> 2.1625705189011626
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mr <EOS> 2.7900144722392404
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman <EOS> 2.9635981698569083

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls <EOS> 2.550879562291461

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> is she handsome <EOS> 2.939516946498256
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she is a most charming young lady indeed <EOS> 3.1811864312567697
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them <EOS> 2.206451629534268
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies <EOS> 2.0985632372878147
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> has she been presented <EOS> 2.812440299468141
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i do not remember her name among the ladies at court <EOS> 2.9360429855781796
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament <EOS> 1.9029324471369047
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies <EOS> 2.9580080058935057
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her <EOS> 2.428388352022245
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay <EOS> 2.6842803151547905
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy <EOS> 2.817797234628823
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study <EOS> 2.5025887175015
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible <EOS> 2.0560269451246977
