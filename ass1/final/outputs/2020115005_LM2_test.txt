<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mr <EOS> 3.747306958730166

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing <EOS> 4.131290285433918
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> what can have induced him to behave so cruelly <EOS> 2.7377828187723288

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you <EOS> 3.9269748816411965

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley <EOS> 4.483199454195046

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man <EOS> 5.2969601402491255

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance <EOS> 5.466699934231485

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as missarcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning <EOS> 5.89532486199132

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern <EOS> 2.674136853959787
