<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes <EOS> 1.9665273488528145

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> jane was by no means better <EOS> 3.944670155435187
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike <EOS> 2.093705123425489
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency <EOS> 3.1835074767918785
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others <EOS> 2.028406558616741
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she had very little notice from any but him <EOS> 2.713641347839041

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty <EOS> 2.446046637510268

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me <EOS> 2.212182904749847
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i thought misslizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning <EOS> 2.5181767329398785
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice <EOS> 2.7212779209014877
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you observed it mr darcy i am sure said missingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition <EOS> 2.945615683027153
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> certainly not <EOS> 5.275089358182591

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley <EOS> 3.331567204841919
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i am afraid mr darcy observed missingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes <EOS> 2.101258720777034
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise <EOS> 2.70076969376041

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton <EOS> 2.767069203669091
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside <EOS> 2.478857001259949
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily <EOS> 2.9300663896331756
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable <EOS> 2.2719803396650873
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy <EOS> 2.5095461690040546
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations <EOS> 2.041096997121359

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes i do comprehend a great deal in it <EOS> 3.160959406562534

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved <EOS> 1.8249489057567154
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading <EOS> 2.2026831203288446

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room <EOS> 2.5191825219533923
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation <EOS> 1.9302635967869948
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable <EOS> 2.673150064540884

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation <EOS> 2.1310542541150097

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting <EOS> 1.8572747171474997
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance <EOS> 2.0581444201031163
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <EOS> 1.984909788632905

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember missennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety <EOS> 1.9316947426655176
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you <EOS> 2.440838318215902

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter <EOS> 2.496061236176161
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when that business was over he applied to missingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music <EOS> 2.491498642572967
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself <EOS> 2.0288878769515244
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her <EOS> 2.3758492814297965
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange <EOS> 2.568278312737924
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present <EOS> 2.2026970885843444
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the supposition did not pain her <EOS> 3.152673845879961

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> after playing some italian songs missingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination missennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel <EOS> 2.010045463935777
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she smiled but made no answer <EOS> 3.1047448459756057

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply <EOS> 2.9143055649626715
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt <EOS> 2.083510955967089
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare <EOS> 2.562245187816874
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> indeed i do not dare <EOS> 4.970088229502446
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her <EOS> 2.271354309671119
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth <EOS> 1.9933870150532864
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance <EOS> 1.948670470241682
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers <EOS> 2.254114792583692

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared <EOS> 2.38300427132534

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> missingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps <EOS> 2.579910826558021
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he addressed himself directly to missennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation <EOS> 2.1160556155521806

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours misslizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her <EOS> 2.10756843447248

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her <EOS> 1.9473759565660704

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here <EOS> 2.203331299369282
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make <EOS> 1.952765678244559

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification <EOS> 2.180688877099341
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give <EOS> 1.8705839308224996
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the moment of her release from him was ecstacy <EOS> 2.8556788623353104

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance <EOS> 2.0929088550445494
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he replied and was again silent <EOS> 3.477621950170776

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine <EOS> 2.398312423803384

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance <EOS> 2.1483580196367504
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the effect was immediate <EOS> 3.8284837737271724
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on <EOS> 2.174192149974947
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life <EOS> 2.4334184147096782

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner <EOS> 2.103444481863169

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together <EOS> 2.07329045229955
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of <EOS> 2.2089039307468727

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable <EOS> 1.9042120887199616

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish missennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either <EOS> 2.1153257991493626
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied <EOS> 2.581689855830031
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another <EOS> 1.9678801289530479
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> they had not long separated when missingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so missliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham <EOS> 2.104582105634161

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner <EOS> 2.1804848551326104
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way <EOS> 2.3880023861956183
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it <EOS> 2.500938474050379

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear <EOS> 2.04086508827066

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf <EOS> 2.0200355343793883
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own <EOS> 2.156788033158332
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but we are all liable to error <EOS> 3.1434166095357075
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have certainly meant well through the whole affair <EOS> 2.99730423835373

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the discussion of mr collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother <EOS> 2.4410089199943648
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence <EOS> 1.9767733103817742
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to missucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend <EOS> 2.4520386018959384

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over <EOS> 2.293189837047687
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed <EOS> 2.655508323774662
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself <EOS> 2.4767577799205673
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her <EOS> 2.068897521833806
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother <EOS> 2.3952196440552083
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> soon after their return a letter was delivered to missennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately <EOS> 2.288263714686264
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages <EOS> 2.0708162423329215
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs <EOS> 1.9295583860254575
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal <EOS> 2.1796424947351496
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again <EOS> 2.44209694224462
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you shall hear what she says <EOS> 3.216611459259206

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the next was in these words <EOS> 3.6207105661862617
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence <EOS> 1.8362639632172355
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i depend on you for that <EOS> 3.303430279956383
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his <EOS> 2.236490135549576
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country <EOS> 2.6987053243407386

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel <EOS> 2.051303024820921

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get missarcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if misse bourgh were out of the way <EOS> 1.97936878935738
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because missingley tells you her brother greatly admires missarcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend <EOS> 2.1974511177366667

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together <EOS> 2.201274128060285

<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand <EOS> 2.3055618232130772
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer <EOS> 2.9045954492676924
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security <EOS> 2.37554602251308
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned <EOS> 2.004949449597463
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you <EOS> 2.3997852566386246
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration <EOS> 2.775254948680357
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation <EOS> 2.153982208355104
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> mr darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise <EOS> 2.0811233271503813
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature <EOS> 2.2466866369973073
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it <EOS> 2.350425634679986
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful <EOS> 3.5227328114560628
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting <EOS> 2.7172567723652183
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected <EOS> 2.3721845244291737
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but it is of small importance <EOS> 3.815213881455736
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character <EOS> 1.9403114753010164
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but i have other provocations <EOS> 3.4726617166213853
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you know i have <EOS> 3.8929069660291113
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister <EOS> 2.321100327772257
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> i have every reason in the world to think ill of you <EOS> 3.146711090627426
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there <EOS> 2.198412659512994
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind <EOS> 1.9982357757694875
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse <EOS> 2.2322738658810337
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity <EOS> 3.413222060335486
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> can you deny that you have done it <EOS> 3.601029887819229
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> she repeated <EOS> 4.990268643453193
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success <EOS> 2.4304276691212827
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> towards him i have been kinder than towards myself <EOS> 3.508078097102019
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her <EOS> 2.118203212541692
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded <EOS> 2.513349964902557
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham <EOS> 2.3024808599364532
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> on this subject what can you have to say <EOS> 3.428037468913631
<SOS> <SOS> <SOS> in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself <EOS> 2.4997655163370958
